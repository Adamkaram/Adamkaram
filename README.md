Just a Homo sapiens sapiens looking to make money like Jeff Bezos without no knowledge of how to code just copypasta from AI tools and taking advice from Twitter tech leader and ex-google ex-amazon ex-FANG mang person who tells don't learn to code (Techlead).  I'm kidding just I love to code and build performant projects  




## FYI

- Don't smoke cigarettes! 
- eat a banana every day before sleeping and another one after u wake up 
- I love my family  and my cat
